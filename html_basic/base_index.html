    <p>
      Hello! My name is [Your Name], and this is my very first portfolio
      website. I am learning HTML and building the foundation for my web
      development journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project is part of my practice in structuring web pages, using
      headings, paragraphs, and adding images with links.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am passionate about coding, problem solving, and creating projects that
      bring ideas to life. I aim to continue improving and build bigger things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for visiting this page! I will keep updating my portfolio as I
      progress further in my web development path.
    </p>
